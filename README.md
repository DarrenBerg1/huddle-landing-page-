![Design preview for the Huddle landing page with single introductory section](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Icons were obtained through bootstrap (SVG)

### What I learned

I learned a lot when it comes to CSS flexbox and organizing your work. I also learned how to place an image in the background and using z-index to ensure that you can place items over it. 
I was able to continue learning mobile first development by implementing media queries. (next time i can add more... tablet, med screen/ large screen)
